          <p>Der Baseline Water Stress wird vom World Resources Institute (WRI) bestimmt.</p>
          Link: https://github.com/rutgerhofste/aqueduct30_country_rankings_data_download/blob/master/metadata.md <br>

          Baseline water stress measures the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies. 
          Water withdrawals include domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock consumptive and nonconsumptive uses. 
          Available renewable water supplies include the impact of upstream consumptive water users and large dams on downstream water availability. 
          Higher values indicate more competition among users.

            For more information, ask the Aqueduct team. The methodology document is almost ready.

            The updated country and province data builds on the previous version: “a weighted aggregation of spatially distinct hydrological indicators” with updated data, updated weights and different spatial units. In addition, the results are simplified to resonate better with the users. The method has three input datasets:
            <ol>
                <li>Source indicators</li>
                <li>Gridded (pixel) weights; and</li>
                <li>Target regions (countries, provinces).</li>
              </ol>
